# Educational Course SPA (BOM/SPA Project)

A modern, lightweight Single Page Application (SPA) designed for educational course presentations. This project demonstrates how to handle client-side routing and state management using the **Browser Object Model (BOM)** and **JavaScript** without any external frameworks.

## 🚀 Features
- **Client-side Routing:** Navigation handled via `location.hash` and `hashchange` events.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Content is injected into a single viewport based on the current URL hash.
- **Interactive Registration:** A custom-built form that captures user data and displays it on a dynamic "Thank You" page.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design using CSS custom properties.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized into modular files for better maintainability:
- `course-landing.html` — The main entry point and HTML skeleton.
- `course-styles.css` — Modern UI components and layouts.
- `spa-router.js` — Core logic for routing, page rendering, and data handling.
